abstract = {During the summer of 1994 a glaciometeorological experiment was carried out on the Pasterze (a glacier in Austria). This paper reports on the data from six energy-balance stations ranging in altitude from 2075 to 3225 m above sea level (asl). The wind regime was dominated by the glacier wind. On the tongue, directional constancies ranged between 0.94 and 0.97. Mean 2 m wind speed and specifie humidity were almost constant along the glacier. The variation in the 2 m temperature along the glacier cannot be described by the usually assumed constant decrease with elevation. On the tongue the 2 m temperature even increased with elevation. A much better description of the temperature distribution is given by a linear relation between the potential temperature and the distance along the flow line. This can be understood from a simple thermodynamic analysis of the glacier-wind layer. It is further shown that changes in clear-sky global radiation with elevation are due mainly to changes in local albedo and relief and hardly at all to changes in absolute optical path length and atmospheric water vapor and aerosol content. On the tongue the laterally averaged ice albedo is almost constant with elevation. The flux of incoming long-wave radiation during clear-sky conditions at U2 (2310 m asl) was 48 W/m2 higher than the flux at U5 (3225 m asl), on average. More than half of the difference was due to systematic differences in the shape of the temperature profile (probably the inversion depth is larger at U2). The rest can be ascribed to higher 2 m temperatures and larger amounts of upper hemisphere slopes at U2. The distributions of the meteorological variables and the parameterizations described in this paper might be incorporated in surface energy-balance models designed to simulate the surface mass balance.},

The data are screened for optically thicker overcast cases, after which an empirically derived formulation is used to estimate the fractional sky cover for the remaining data. The retrieved fractional sky cover time series is then evaluated to mitigate times of anomalous behavior caused by the thick overcast screening. The resultant sky cover estimates show a high degree of repeatability given nominally well maintained and operated radiometer systems and the use of the Long and Ackerman (2000) methodology for estimating the clear-sky total and diffuse SW. Thus the resultant fractional sky-cover estimates appear to be fairly independent of the particular climate regime and model of radiometers used, at least for the climate regimes we have tested so far. The sky-cover estimates agree to better than 10\% root mean square sky cover amount with sky imager retrievals and human observations, which is as good as the agreement between sky imaging systems and observers themselves. As such, this methodology becomes a powerful tool for satellite and model validations and climatological analyses including the study of trends in cloud amount. Analysis shows that the technique also produces realistic frequency distributions, showing that the continental midlatitude regimes included in the study are typified by clear-sky occurring about 1/3 of the time, overcast about 1/3 of the time, and partly cloudy skies to varying extent occurring the remaining 1/3 of the time. By contrast, the tropical western Pacific oceanic regime during the Nauru99 field experiment exhibits far more frequent occurrence of partly cloudy skies, with sky cover amounts of 20\% to 50\% occurring about half the time.},

The Ladakh region lies in the northernmost state of India, Jammu and Kashmir, in the Ladhak range. It has a unique cold-arid climate and lies immediately south of the Karakorum range. With scarce water resources, such regions show high sensitivity and vulnerability to the change in climate and need urgent attention. The objective of this study is to understand the climate of the Ladakh region and to characterize its changing climate. Using different temperature and precipitation datasets over Leh and surrounding regions, we statistically analyze the current trends of climatic patterns over the region. The study shows that the climate over Leh shows a warming trend with reduced precipitation in the current decade. The reduced average seasonal precipitation might also be associated with some indications of reducing number of days with higher precipitation amounts over the region.},

abstract = {Abstract Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of near-surface temperature is a fundamental task of climatology that remains especially challenging in mountain regions. Here we assess the regional monitoring capabilities of modern reanalysis products in the well-monitored northern Swiss Alps during the last 20–60 years. Monthly and seasonal 2 m air temperature (T2m) anomalies the global ERA5 and the three regional reanalysis products HARMONIE, MESCAN-SURFEX and COSMO-REA6 are evaluated against high quality in situ observational data for a low elevation (foothills) mean, and a high elevation (Alpine) mean. All reanalysis products show a good year-round performance for the foothills with the global reanalysis ERA5 showing the best overall performance. The high-resolution regional reanalysis COSMO-REA6 clearly performs best for the Alpine mean, especially in winter. Most reanalysis data sets show deficiencies at high elevations in winter and considerably overestimate recent T2m trends in winter. This stresses the fact that even in the most recent decades utmost care is required when using reanalysis data for near-surface temperature trend assessments in mountain regions. Our results indicate that a high-resolution model topography is an important prerequisite for an adequate monitoring of winter T2m using reanalysis data at high elevations in the Alps. Assimilating T2m remains challenging in highly complex terrain. The remaining shortcomings of modern reanalyses also highlight the continued need for a reliable and dense in situ observational monitoring network in mountain regions.}

abstract = "Ski resorts increasingly rely on snow making to ensure good quality skiing regardless of the variability of the natural snow cover. This study aims to quantify past changes in snow making conditions based on an analysis of long-term wet bulb temperature time series from 20 weather stations in Germany and Austria. The weather stations are located at a range of altitudes from 267 m to 3109 m, in the vicinity of ski resorts. The lengths of the time-series range from 54 to 83 years. Using a threshold mean daily wet bulb temperature of −2 °C we define ‘potential snow making days’ and track changes in the number of snow making days in the months of the early skiing season (October, November, December) by computing linear trends, comparing consecutive 20 year periods, and Mann-Kendall trend testing of overlapping sub-periods. The number of snow making days changes least in October and most in December when averaged over all stations. Very high stations show more change in October and less change in December than the lower stations. Several stations show a significant decrease of snow making days per month, particularly in more recent sub-periods, but trends vary strongly between stations and for different sub-periods. Sub-periods with positive trends are present in earlier phases of the time series at some stations and inter-annual variability is generally 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than detected trends. Detailed microclimatic studies are necessary to determine potential future effects of changes in snow making conditions on the scale of a ski resort."

    abstract = { Modelling ice and snow melt is of large practical and scientific interest, including issues such as water resource management, avalanche forecasting, glacier dynamics, hydrology and hydrochemistry, as well as the response of glaciers to climate change. During the last few decades, a large variety of melt models have been developed, ranging from simple temperature-index to sophisticated energy-balance models. There is a recent trend towards modelling with both high temporal and spatial resolution, the latter accomplished by fully distributed models. This review discusses the relevant processes at the surface-atmosphere interface, and their representation in melt models. Despite considerable advances in distributed melt modelling there is still a need to refine and develop models with high spatial and temporal resolution based on moderate input data requirements. While modelling of incoming radiation in mountain terrain is relatively accurate, modelling of turbulent fluxes and spatial and temporal variability in albedo constitute major uncertainties in current energy-balance melt models, and thus need further research. }

abstract = "The directional emissivity of snow and ice surfaces in the 8–14 μm thermal infrared (TIR) atmospheric window was determined from spectral radiances obtained by field measurements using a portable Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in conjunction with snow pit work. The dependence of the directional emissivity on the surface snow type (grain size and shape) was examined. We obtained emissivity spectra for five different surface types, i.e., fine dendrite snow, medium granular snow, coarse grain snow, welded sun crust snow, and smooth bare ice. The derived emissivities show a distinct spectral contrast at wavelengths λ=10.5–12.5 μm which is enhanced with increasing the snow grain size. For example, emissivities at both 10.5 μm and 12.5 μm for the nadir angle were 0.997 and 0.984 for the fine dendrite snow, 0.996 and 0.974 for the medium granular snow, 0.995 and 0.971 for the coarse grain snow, 0.992 and 0.968 for the sun crust, and 0.993 and 0.949 for the bare ice, respectively. In addition, the spectral contrast exhibits a strong angular dependence, particularly for the coarser snow and bare ice, e.g., the emissivity at λ=12.5 μm for the off-nadir angle of 75° reaches down to 0.927, 0.896, and 0.709 for the coarse grain snow, sun crust, and bare ice cases, respectively. The angular dependent emissivity spectra of the bare ice were quite consistent with the spectra predicted by the Fresnel reflectance theory. The observed results firmly demonstrate that the directional emissivity of snow in the TIR can vary depending upon the surface snow type. The high variability of the spectral emissivity of snow also suggests the possibility to discriminate between snow and ice types from space using the brightness temperature difference in the atmospheric window."
