abstract = {During the summer of 1994 a glaciometeorological experiment was carried out on the Pasterze (a glacier in Austria). This paper reports on the data from six energy-balance stations ranging in altitude from 2075 to 3225 m above sea level (asl). The wind regime was dominated by the glacier wind. On the tongue, directional constancies ranged between 0.94 and 0.97. Mean 2 m wind speed and specifie humidity were almost constant along the glacier. The variation in the 2 m temperature along the glacier cannot be described by the usually assumed constant decrease with elevation. On the tongue the 2 m temperature even increased with elevation. A much better description of the temperature distribution is given by a linear relation between the potential temperature and the distance along the flow line. This can be understood from a simple thermodynamic analysis of the glacier-wind layer. It is further shown that changes in clear-sky global radiation with elevation are due mainly to changes in local albedo and relief and hardly at all to changes in absolute optical path length and atmospheric water vapor and aerosol content. On the tongue the laterally averaged ice albedo is almost constant with elevation. The flux of incoming long-wave radiation during clear-sky conditions at U2 (2310 m asl) was 48 W/m2 higher than the flux at U5 (3225 m asl), on average. More than half of the difference was due to systematic differences in the shape of the temperature profile (probably the inversion depth is larger at U2). The rest can be ascribed to higher 2 m temperatures and larger amounts of upper hemisphere slopes at U2. The distributions of the meteorological variables and the parameterizations described in this paper might be incorporated in surface energy-balance models designed to simulate the surface mass balance.},

abstract = {We outline a methodology for estimating fractional sky cover for an effective 160° field of view from an analysis of surface measurements of downwelling total and diffuse shortwave (SW) irradiance. The data are screened for optically thicker overcast cases, after which an empirically derived formulation is used to estimate the fractional sky cover for the remaining data. The retrieved fractional sky cover time series is then evaluated to mitigate times of anomalous behavior caused by the thick overcast screening. The resultant sky cover estimates show a high degree of repeatability given nominally well maintained and operated radiometer systems and the use of the Long and Ackerman (2000) methodology for estimating the clear-sky total and diffuse SW. Thus the resultant fractional sky-cover estimates appear to be fairly independent of the particular climate regime and model of radiometers used, at least for the climate regimes we have tested so far. The sky-cover estimates agree to better than 10\% root mean square sky cover amount with sky imager retrievals and human observations, which is as good as the agreement between sky imaging systems and observers themselves. As such, this methodology becomes a powerful tool for satellite and model validations and climatological analyses including the study of trends in cloud amount. Analysis shows that the technique also produces realistic frequency distributions, showing that the continental midlatitude regimes included in the study are typified by clear-sky occurring about 1/3 of the time, overcast about 1/3 of the time, and partly cloudy skies to varying extent occurring the remaining 1/3 of the time. By contrast, the tropical western Pacific oceanic regime during the Nauru99 field experiment exhibits far more frequent occurrence of partly cloudy skies, with sky cover amounts of 20\% to 50\% occurring about half the time.},

The Ladakh region lies in the northernmost state of India, Jammu and Kashmir, in the Ladhak range. It has a unique cold-arid climate and lies immediately south of the Karakorum range. With scarce water resources, such regions show high sensitivity and vulnerability to the change in climate and need urgent attention. The objective of this study is to understand the climate of the Ladakh region and to characterize its changing climate. Using different temperature and precipitation datasets over Leh and surrounding regions, we statistically analyze the current trends of climatic patterns over the region. The study shows that the climate over Leh shows a warming trend with reduced precipitation in the current decade. The reduced average seasonal precipitation might also be associated with some indications of reducing number of days with higher precipitation amounts over the region.},

abstract = {Abstract Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},
